		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about MilkyTracker</h1>
		<p>
			Here are some questions answered which get asked on the forum and on IRC from time to time.
		</p>
		<ol>

			<li>
				<a>Where can I find a list of all the effect codes?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Read the manual: <a href="milkytracker.html">milkytracker.html</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Where can I find a list of all the keyboard shortcuts?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Read the manual: <a href="milkytracker.html">milkytracker.html</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<li>
				<a>Why does MilkyTracker look different from Fasttracker II?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
							The GUI of MilkyTracker has been adjusted to fit low resolution displays
							with 320x240 pixels. Thus the screen can be more easily divided into
							seperate pages.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Where are the extended Sample Editor functions (S.E.Ext.)?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In the sample context menu, just right-click / tap'n hold in the sample area.
						The Pattern and Instrument Editors have their context menus too, you know.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Why does my .XM sound different from Ft2 in MilkyTracker?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
							MilkyTracker tries to play XMs as accurate as possible but there are still
							known and unknown issues. Most of them are rare but if you find one, report
							it to us and we'll try to fix it.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Why does my .XM sound different from ModPlug/Schism/WinAMP/xxx in MilkyTracker?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
							MilkyTracker aims to reproduce Ft2 playback as closely as possible while
							other players/trackers don't do that, so if you think your track is being
							messed up in MilkyTracker compare it to Ft2 first. If it still sounds
							weird, see the question above.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Why doesn't MilkyTracker load my .XM (created in ModPlug)?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unless the module is otherwise corrupt, it probably features more than 32
						channels. In Fasttracker II, 32 is the maximum.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a>Why does MilkyTracker play my IT/S3M/xxx module wrong?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
							Well, MilkyTracker is an XM tracker. It will play all other tunes (except
							for .MOD) the way Ft2 would do it. Every feature from other modules not
							being XM compatible will be thrown out when importing the song.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>What do the buttons SEQ, CLN, F, P, W and L do?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						SEQ stands for sequence, the button inserts the next unused pattern in the
						pattern order table.
					</li>
					<li>
						CLN stands for clone, it does the same as SEQ but additionally it copies the
						data from current pattern to the new one.
					</li>
					<li>
						The F button toggles song following. Disabling it enables you to better edit the
						song while it is playing.
					</li>
					<li>
						The P button toggles prospective pattern view. When disabled, you see one
						pattern at a time. When enabled, the patterns show as a continuous strip.
					</li>
					<li>
						The W button toggles pattern wrapping. Basically it either allows you to freely
						move from pattern to pattern while editing or helps you concentrate on one
						pattern at a time.
					</li>
					<li>
						The L button toggles live mode. This affects the pattern change behavior. When
						it's off, changing song positions is instant. In live mode, the change happens
						after the current pattern has been finished which allows seamless skipping from
						one part of a song to another. Repetitions, jamming, you know, generic live stuff. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>What are Jam channels?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Jam channels enable you to play notes live on your MIDI or computer keyboard
						independent of the song channels. If disabled, note polyphony is restricted to
						whatever number of channels the song has.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Does MilkyTracker support MIDI?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						MilkyTracker supports some basic MIDI INPUT, which means you can use your MIDI
						device to feed notes into MilkyTracker. See the documentation for instructions
						on how to enable MIDI In on different platforms.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Can you port MilkyTracker to platform xxx?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unfortunately my time is rather limited at the moment so first you need to know
						some things about MilkyTracker:
					</li>	
					<li>
						MilkyTracker is written in a platform independent fashion and uses a rather
						primitive approach of software rendering to make porting as easy as possible. On
						the downside this means MilkyTracker needs quite some CPU power. At the bottom
						end of the desktop version MilkyTracker requires at least around 300Mhz to run
						MilkyTracker in 640x480x16 bit color. This might seem quite a bit, but actually
						it's nothing compared to nowadays computer speeds. MilkyTracker was never
						written with old computer systems in mind. The low resolution version (320x240)
						will probably run on systems offering 150Mhz or more but 320x240 is the only
						supported low resolution mode. 
					</li>
					<li>
						MilkyTracker is *heavily* mouse centered. And I really mean *heavy*. Controlling
						MilkyTracker with a few buttons only will not be fun and totally useless and I'm
						not going to waste time on a port for a device without a mouse equivalent (touch
						screen etc.). Please understand that porting itself often requires quite an
						amount of time and still doesn't guarentee MilkyTracker to be fully useable.					
					</li>
					<li>
						Now that MilkyTracker is open-source the opportunity exists for anyone with enough motivation to port MilkyTracker to whatever platform they desire.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Why isn't there a PSP/NDS port of MilkyTracker?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Because noone has had the motivation to write one. Perhaps you do :)

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a>Can you tell me a bedtime story?</a>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Yes. Once upon a time&hellip;<pre>
11:32	anyguy has joined #MilkyTracker
11:32	pailes yawns
11:32	&lt;anyguy&gt; Hi
11:32	&lt;pailes&gt; hi there
11:33	&lt;anyguy&gt; this sounds terrible, but i just downloaded milky traker and i have no idea how to use it
11:33	&lt;anyguy&gt; any help?
11:34	&lt;pailes&gt; load a song
11:34	&lt;pailes&gt; play it
11:34	&lt;pailes&gt; maybe watch the video tutorials
11:34	&lt;anyguy&gt; the vids on youtube were no help
11:34	&lt;pailes&gt; what was the problem?
11:35	&lt;anyguy&gt; i have no idea how to work milky traker
11:35	&lt;pailes&gt; I guess you have to be more specific
11:36	&lt;anyguy&gt; i cant even make a simple sound or track
11:36	&lt;pailes&gt; can you load a song and play it?
11:36	&lt;anyguy&gt; no clue how?
11:37	&lt;pailes&gt; "load" a song 
11:37	&lt;pailes&gt; there is a "load" button
11:37	&lt;pailes&gt; which suggests you should press it to load a song
11:37	&lt;anyguy&gt; i know, but its all... blah, file types
11:38	&lt;anyguy&gt; error loading file type
11:38	&lt;pailes&gt; you can only load songs which have the .xm extension
11:38	&lt;pailes&gt; i.e. some of the songs which are included in the milkytracker distribution package
11:39	&lt;anyguy&gt; nice, but how do i edit or build on that?
11:39	&lt;pailes&gt; first I suggest to press the config button
11:40	&lt;pailes&gt; then select the misc. tab by pressing the misc. button
11:40	&lt;pailes&gt; and switch to milkytracker edit mode
11:40	&lt;pailes&gt; this mode will be easier to use
11:41	&lt;pailes&gt; for people not having any tracking background
11:41	&lt;anyguy&gt; so for now on out, trial and error?
11:41	&lt;anyguy&gt; this is alien to me
11:41	&lt;pailes&gt; when you have enabled milkytracker edit mode you can edit pattern data by clicking into the pattern, this will focus the pattern editor
11:41	&lt;pailes&gt; rec. will turn red
11:42	&lt;anyguy&gt; i see
11:42	&lt;pailes&gt; which means you can edit pattern data
11:42	&lt;pailes&gt; you can enter regular notes by pressing keys on your pc keyboard
11:42	&lt;pailes&gt; c, c#, d, etc.
11:43	&lt;anyguy&gt; how do i clear it all and use the samples
11:43	&lt;pailes&gt; pres "zap" and then "song"
11:43	&lt;pailes&gt; it will preserve the samples
11:44	&lt;anyguy&gt; so how do i start now?
11:44	&lt;pailes&gt; try to find which key on the keyboard maps to which note... there are also some documents which you can read to understand how a tracker works
11:45	&lt;pailes&gt; you can change the octave with the function keys btw. only two octaves of notes are available at a time through the keyboard, if you want to change the octave you need to do it manually 
11:45	&lt;anyguy&gt; can i change the speed?
11:47	&lt;pailes&gt; you do that by inserting a speed command in the last column of a track (a track are those vertical units in the pattern)
11:47	&lt;pailes&gt; everything is done using those commands
11:49	&lt;pailes&gt; maybe this helps: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker
11:50	&lt;pailes&gt; although this article is a little bit outdated
12:06	&lt;anyguy&gt; god i suck at this
12:16	&lt;anyguy&gt; i dont know what im doing wrong here
12:17	&lt;pailes&gt; you can't learn tracking in a few minutes... it really takes some dedication and time
12:17	&lt;anyguy&gt; how do i start though
12:19	&lt;pailes&gt; reading and trial and error
12:20	&lt;pailes&gt; and loading songs and listen to them and find out how they're made by altering sample and pattern data
12:25	&lt;anyguy&gt; blaw
12:25	anyguy has disconnected: Quit: Saving BACKUP.XM...
12:26	&lt;pailes&gt; yes, bye bye</pre>
