		<h2>05/20/07 (v0.90.60):</h2>
		<h3>Whats New:</h3>

			<li>New imported (obscure) module formats (mainly for personal satisfaction):
				<ul>
					<li>Another DSM format (Digisound Interface Kit library)</li>
					<li>Another AMF format (DSMI library)</li>
					<li>SFX (SoundFX)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Four new 8x8 fonts (thanks to idc and Rez)</li>
			<li>Set custom screen resolution</li>
			<li>Scrollbars in the list boxes dynamically show/hide depending on content (saves some space)</li>
			<li>Row preview with Shift+Space</li>
			<li>Song Preview Alt+Space</li>
			<li>Integrated disk browser (click "flip" in the disk operations panel)</li>
			<li>Sample editor got EQ filters now (3 and 10 bands)</li>
			<li>Sample editor got waveform generators for sine, square, triangle and sawtooth</li>
			<li>Solid scopes (ProTracker style, toggle in the config under the misc. tab)</li>
			<li>Pattern replay is a bit more like Ft2 now (switching to different pattern doesn't reset cursor to row 0)</li>
			<li>Clone button to clone the current order</li>
			<li>"Mix paste" in the sample editor: paste in a sample from the clipboard and get it mixed with the current selection/entire sample.</li>
			<li>As usually: more Ft2-compatible replay</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bugs Fixed:</h3>
		<h4>Replay</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A severe volume ramping bug has been fixed</li>
			<li>Instrument auto vibrato ramp wave forms were swapped</li>
			<li>Fixed several issues in the replayer which were causing problems when using EDx and Mx and similiar combinations</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Other</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Orders containing pattern number FF vanished from modules saved from Ft2.</li>
            <li>Loading arbitrary files as samples adds the filename to the sample text.</li>
            <li>The y-axis in the sample editor was flipped (negative side was on the top).</li>
            <li>Toggling scopes in the config with the keyboard left the checkbox unaffected.</li>
            <li>Crash: A bug in the IFF reader crashes MilkyTracker when loading some IFF samples.</li>
            <li>Crash: After adding channels and saving as MOD.</li>
            <li>Saving MOD with extended octaves (5 instead of 3) produces results like FT2 now.</li>
            <li>Crash: (on Linux x86_64, strange behavior elsewhere): Caused by illegal 16-bit zero-length samples, as saved by Soundtracker.</li>
            <li>Crash: when loading modules without instruments.</li>
            <li>FREEZE: when zooming way in/loading LOOONG instrument envelopes.</li>
			<li>FREEZE (on Windows Vista): when initializing audio on startup.</li>
            <li>Assigning samples to notes in the instrument editor by clicking and holding (painting) doesn't have effect on C-0.</li>
            <li>Certain hot words in song titles cause incorrect module format detection (improved at least ;)).</li>
            <li>Clear button above sample box didn't work properly.</li>
            <li>Dxx on the last row of a pattern caused a display error when xx is greater than the number of rows on the current pattern.</li>
            <li>Insert silence screwed up 16 bit samples.</li>
            <li>Instrument panning settings defaulted to center on key-release when key-jamming.</li>
            <li>Optimizer functions "Minimize all samples" and "Samples to 8-bit" triggered one another when only one of them were selected.</li>
            <li>Selection block is truncated to current pattern length (you know, after being taller on a taller pattern).</li>
            <li>Several things like applying sample editor filters and using the optimizer reset global volume.</li>
            <li>Other things I can't remember :P</li>
		</ul>	

		<h2>09/26/06 (v0.90.50), Tons of fixes and added features:</h2>
		<h3>Whats New:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>New platforms supported:
				<ul>
					<li>FreeBSD (x86)</li>
					<li>Linux (x86, x86_64, PowerPC, ARM, GP2X)</li>
					<li>Solaris 9 &amp; 10 (SPARC)</li>
					<li>Windows (ANSI)</li>
					<li>Windows CE Handheld PCs and the Gizmondo</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>New imported module formats:
				<ul>
					<li>DBM (DigiBooster Pro)</li>
					<li>GMC (Game Music Creator)</li>
					<li>IT (Impulse Tracker)
						<ul>
							<li>NOTE: MilkyTracker will remain an Ft2 clone, importing converts everything to this environment
							and accurate playback is not pursued. It's just like with the rest of the imported formats apart from
							MOD and XM.</li>
							<li>MORE IMPORTANTLY: MilkyTracker refuses to import modules with more than 32 channels. It's not that
							the XM format couldn't handle it but the Fasttracker II framework doesn't, so there.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Low-latency audio driver support:
				<ul>
					<li>ALSA on Linux</li>
					<li>ASIO and DirectX on Win32, thanks to <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/">RtAudio</a>
						<ul>
							<li>48kHz mixing resolution now available also on Win32. NOTE: MMSYSTEM/WaveOut can't handle 48kHz, so don't mix these two.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Adjustable MOD channel panning</li>
			<li>Adjustable opacity for muted channels</li>
			<li>Alternate view in the main panel showing Add, Octave and Global volume values</li>
			<li>Fasttracker II edit mode and scrolling style loaded by default</li>
			<li>MIDI in with velocity and note delay/off recording (works on your QWERTY too), thanks to <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/">RtMidi</a></li>
			<li>Module optimization panel</li>
			<li>Pattern row highlighting, two independent intervals</li>
			<li>Sample editor noise generators</li>
			<li>Selectable pattern/UI fonts</li>
			<li>Skippable splash screen</li>
			<li>Volume boost/fade dialogs accept negative values (useful for chip sample generation, sample phase inversion etc)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bugs Fixed:</h3>
		<h4>Replay</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A rogue EDx note delay without a note should retrigger the previous note when x is lesser than or equal to song speed.</li>
			<li>EDx+EEy, that is delayed notes on a pattern delayed row played when x was larger than or equal to the song speed. Sadly, this
			shouldn't happen according to Ft2, thus it doesn't anymore.</li>
			<li>E5x finetune setting implemented.</li>
			<li>E9x note retrig was a little off, now it's ever closer to Ft2.</li>
			<li>F00 speed setting wasn't implemented, now it stops playback
				<ul>
					<li>Fasttracker II slows down to advancing one row every 10 or so minutes. If you can justify this
					behavior, i.e. convince us how you can rationally utilize it (a 10 minute pause) in a song, it will be
					implemented.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>K00 did not send a noteOff but set the volume to zero.</li>
			<li>Mx volume column tone portamento acted as M0 when starting a song from scratch and you couldn't actually enter an M0
			because a 1 was was automatically filled in as the parameter. All fixed and dandy now.</li>
			<li>Rxx multiretrig, see E9x.</li>
			<li>Something clicked in the mixer, literally. Now smoother than a baby's butt.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>User interface</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A channel could get stuck playing only one instrument when volume ramping was off. Ain't life peculiar?</li>
			<li>A crash happened when selecting a range in sample editor and the mouse was released outside the MilkyTracker window followed by
			a cut or copy operation. You see the selection was still in progress and the poor tracker got confused because it didn't know where
			the range started/ended.</li>
			<li>A pattern that was deleted from the orderlist remained on the screen.</li>
			<li>An instrument stayed selected after it had been removed with the minus button.</li>
			<li>Block operation areas did not always match block selections.</li>
			<li>Global volume wasn't reset on stop/play.</li>
			<li>Key release now effects the correct note (not necessarily the note that is playing).</li>
			<li>Multisample instruments got rearranged/optimized automatically.</li>
			<li>Scrollbar positions were reset upon screen switches. Added botox.</li>
			<li>Standard-breaking XI instruments (w/ stereo and more than 16 samples) were crashing MilkyTracker. Now stereo is converted to mono
			and surplus samples are dismissed.</li>
			<li>The MilkyTracker window insisted on staying topmost after switching from fullscreen to windowed.</li>
			<li>The F10 key brought up the system menu on Win32. Now it just jumps to row 10h like it's supposed to.</li>
			<li>The selection disappeared after pasting a block. Doesn't anymore.</li>
			<li>When tabbing to a channel outside the current display, the screen shifted one whole "page". Very confusing for young,
			fragile artists. Now it moves one channel at a time, à la Ft2.</li>
		</ul>	

		<h2>02/14/06 (v0.90.30), Mainly bugfixes and minor additions:</h2>
